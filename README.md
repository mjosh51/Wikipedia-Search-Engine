# Wikipedia-Search-Engine
A wiki search engine built with HTML, CSS and Pure Javascript. It calls the Wikipedia API on each request and display result according to app HTML structure. Being a beginner project in working with Javascript.

<ul>
  <li>Create an HTML structure  for the app. It should contain basically two sections - the header and the main body.</li>
  <li>Apply styling according to preference. <i>The better position for the app content would be a center</i></li>
  <li>Get HTML elements using Javascript query selector. Get the form element by query selector and apply an event listener</li>
  <li>Create Functions to execute when event is executed. Likely functions are handleSubmit, searchWikipedia, displayResult<br>The handleSubmit will get user input and submit as a query string. The searchWikipedia function fetch API endpoint and append the search query from user input (from submit function). Finally the displayResult displays the query results from Wikipedia</li>
  <li>Add a spinner effect to animate a loading effect</li>
</ul>
